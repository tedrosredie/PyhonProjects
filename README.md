# Training Plan
This is the overall training plan for backend programming using python 

* **Basic python**
  + **Inventory project using CSV file**\
    Develop a python program that will create a CSV file "inventory.csv" that will contain inventory records/rows, and also insert/update/delete/search records or rows in the file "inventory.csv"
  + **Inventory project using JSON file**\
    Develop a python program that will create a JSON file "inventory.json" that will contain inventory records/rows, and also insert/update/delete/search records or rows in the file "inventory.json"
  + **Side training: linux, git**\
    You will need to watch turorial YouTube videos on linux and git, and also practice on your terminal

* **MongoDB and python**
  + **Installation, commands from console**\
    You will need to install and setup MongoDB with authentication enabled, login to the console and perform Mongo commands to create/drop/list databases, create/drop/list collections, insert/update/delete documents from a collection ... and learn many other Mongo commands
  + **Interaction to MongoDB using python**\
    Using the python module "pymongo", write a python program that connects to your MongoDB and perform all kinds of Mongo commands. Once this is done, you will implement your inventory application using MongoDB (create a database called "invdb" which will have a collection called "c_inventory" that will contain records/documents for individual inventory items)
  + **Side training: linux, git**\
    You will need to watch turorial YouTube videos on linux and git, and also practice on your terminal
    
* **APIs using Flask**
  + **Flask quick start tutorial**\
    Install Flask and learn the basics by doing the quick start tutorial from your terminal
  + **Implement APIs for the inventory project**\
    Develop APIs that will peform all the backend functions needed for your inventory application
  + **Side training: linux, git**\
    You will need to watch turorial YouTube videos on linux and git, and also practice on your terminal
    
* **Containerization using Docker**
  + **Docker quick start tutorial**\
    Install Docker and learn the basics by doing the quick start tutorial
  + **Containerization of your Flask APIsv**\
    Containerize your Flask API application
  + **Side training: linux, git**\
    You will need to watch turorial YouTube videos on linux and git, and also practice on your terminal
