        "Twitter Sentiment Analysis is the process of using Python to understand the emotions or opinions expressed in tweets automatically. By analyzing the text we can classify tweets as positive, negative or neutral. This helps businesses and researchers track public mood, brand reputation or reactions to events in real time. Python libraries like TextBlob, Tweepy and NLTK make it easy to collect tweets, process the text and perform sentiment analysis efficiently.\n",
